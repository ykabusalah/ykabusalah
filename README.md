## About Me

I'm a data enthusiast and artist who loves working at the intersection of analytics and creativity, especially in entertainment tech. I believe technology should help smaller artists thrive, not get lost in the noise.

Lately I've been exploring how education and entertainment can merge through technology to create learning experiences that are actually fun. Really, any tech that empowers creation and creativity gets me excited.

When I'm not working, you can find me watching soccer or college football, diving into anime, obsessing over Nintendo lore, or just trying to make the world a little better.
