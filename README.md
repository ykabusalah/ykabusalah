## About Me

I'm a technology enthusiast and artist who loves working at the intersection of analytics and creativity, especially in the realms of education and entertainment technology. I firmly believe that through the power of software, entertainment can be magnified and revolutionized in ways that we've never seen before, especially through the power of AI. 

Lately, I've been exploring how education and entertainment can merge through technology to create learning experiences that are both enjoyable and enriching. 

When I'm not working, you can find me watching college football, diving into anime, obsessing over Nintendo lore, or learning to how make food that can rival (however poorly) my mother's divine creations.
